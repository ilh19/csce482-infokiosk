possibly include  aback button on the map its
make button on map bigger
window max size too small probably
too much to scroll on dining
windows should stay up a bit longer
still dont have a message for drag button to move on main screen
transit text too small, possibly change into some screen selecting into it, rather than its current mode, or start its window a bit larger than the others(50px wider may be enough)
